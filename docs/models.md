# Introduction

Alma Acquisitions (Open Source) is a Laravel-based web-application that allows libraries using Alma to display their letest acquisitions on a website.

It uses the Alma Analytics API to retrieve the latest acquisitions, and displays them to the end user.
An administrator can edit the details of an acquisitions list, such the URL path where it should be displayed, and the source in Alma Analytics.

Alma Acquisitions (Open Source) is designed with discoverability in mind, allowing you acquisitions lists to be indexed on search engines.
